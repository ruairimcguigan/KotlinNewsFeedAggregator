# KotlinNewsFeedAggregator

Simple app written in Kotlin. The repo makes use of two great services:
Zapier is a service that allows you to automate messages between web apps, here it is being used to store any new news item in the BBC news feed in the firebase database.
Firebase Realtime Database is used to save news item in the BBC news feed, to be displayed in a simple listview
